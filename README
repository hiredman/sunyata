# storage

I found I wanted a shared persistant map for little odds and ends of code I run 
locally on my laptop. this is a simplifying layer on top of infinispan

## Usage

to setup a node that persists to disk:

lein install storage 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

~/.lein/bin/storage ~/.some-place

then in projects that will consumer this:

in project.clj
[storage "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]

in your ns
(:require [storage.client :as storage])

(storage/put :some-key :some-value)

(storage/get :some-key)
