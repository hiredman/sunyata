* Sunyata
** Why?

I found I wanted a shared persistent map for little odds and ends of code I run 
locally on my laptop. this is a simplifying layer on top of infinispan

the idea is you run the persisting node as a service, and other
clients and write data in or read at using a simple get/put interface

** Usage

to setup a node that persists to disk:

: lein install sunyata 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

: ~/.lein/bin/sunyata ~/.some-place

(I have launchd run the above)

then in projects that will consumer this:

in project.clj

: [sunyata "1.0.0"]

in your ns

: (:require [sunyata.client :as sunyata])

...

: (sunyata/put :some-key :some-value)
: (sunyata/get :some-key)
